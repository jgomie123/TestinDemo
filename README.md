practice making unit tests


Understand the library checkout app: Before writing a test suite for the library checkout app, you should have a clear understanding of how the app works. Read the documentation or talk to your instructor to ensure you know how the app functions.

Identify test cases: Once you understand the app, make a list of different test cases you want to run. For example, you might want to test if a book can be checked out, if a book can be returned, if overdue fees are calculated correctly, and so on.

Write test cases: For each test case, write a test that will verify whether the app is working as expected. Be sure to include both positive and negative test cases. Positive test cases should confirm that the app behaves correctly when everything is working as expected, while negative test cases should check for edge cases and incorrect behavior.

Run the tests: Once you have written your test suite, run the tests to ensure they are working correctly. If any tests fail, investigate the cause of the failure and fix the problem.

Refine the tests: As you run the tests, you may identify areas that need improvement or additional testing. Refine the tests accordingly to ensure comprehensive coverage of the app's functionality.

Repeat: Continue to iterate on your test suite as you make changes to the app, to ensure that the app continues to function correctly.

Remember, writing a good test suite is an essential part of software development. It helps catch bugs early in the development process, and ensures that the app behaves as expected.
